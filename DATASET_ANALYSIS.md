## 3. Feature Engineering

### 3.1 Derived Metrics
We created several engineered features to enhance estimation accuracy:

1. **Complexity-to-Effort Ratio**
   ```python
   Complexity_to_Effort_Ratio = Object_Points / Actual_Effort
   ```

2. **Team Productivity Index**
   ```python
   Team_Productivity = Actual_Effort / (Team_Size * Actual_Duration)
   ```

3. **Project Size Categories**
   ```python
   Size_Category = {
       'Small': < 100 Object Points
       'Medium': 100-500 Object Points
       'Large': > 500 Object Points
   }
   ```

### 3.2 Feature Preprocessing
1. **Normalization**
   - Standard scaling for numerical features
   - Min-Max scaling for bounded metrics

2. **Categorical Encoding**
   - One-hot encoding for nominal categories
   - Label encoding for ordinal features
